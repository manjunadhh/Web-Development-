            Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust,
            object-oriented and secure programming language.
            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.
            James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
            Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

            Simple
            
        </h3>
        <p class="points">
            Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:
            Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
            Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.
            There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.

        </h3>
        <p class="points">
            Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. <br>
            Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.

            Platform Independent
            
        </h3>
        <p class="points">
            Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language.<br> A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
            There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.
            The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:
            Runtime Environment
            API(Application Programming Interface)
            Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).

            Secured
            
        </h3>
        <p class="points">
            Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:
            No explicit pointer
            Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
            Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.
            Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.
            Security Manager: It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
            Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application developer explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.
